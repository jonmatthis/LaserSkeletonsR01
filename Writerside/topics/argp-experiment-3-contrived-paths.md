# ARGP Experiment 3 - Contrived paths

#argp-schema



OLD NOTES


  - Examine gaze/foothold patterns from Aim 1 and Exp 1/2 to determine 'typical' gaze patterns/path selections
  
  - Based on that, create arrangements with "dead-zones" (e.g. large sections of terrain without footholds), with and without "funnels" (i.e. a series of *perfect* steps that lead to a dead-zone)
  
    - examine gaze/gait patterns in these conditions to see when/if subjects notice the coming dead-zone, and how they react to it (i.e. big deviations from PGC (e.g. "whoopsie")? or do they see it coming and avoid more gracefully? cite Barton Matthis Fajen)
    
    - different gaze/gait patterns that occur in different cases (i.e. last-minute replan in a "whoopsie" vs. early replan in a graceful avoidance)
  
  - ALSO/OR - big swoopy curvy paths to look at planning on straight-aheads vs curves (help with the 'planning horizon' thing, because decouples look ahead from path planning due to curvature)
  
    - decouples end-goal planning from short-term step planning
