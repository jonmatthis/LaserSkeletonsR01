The Augmented Reality Ground Plane (developed at Northeastern) is a projector-based, 14m-long indoor walking path. The content of the groundplane is displayed using a series of 3x ultra-short-throw projectors showing images from a Unity game engine that is streaming in realtime kinematic data via websocket. Note that the "realtime" streaming component only needs track feet, so it can be fast while we also record much higher spatial/temportal res videos for later analysis projectors and is real-time interactive, allowing for body-position-dependent updating of displayed terrain, and play real-time auditory feedback to the participant (this is essential for high accuracy footplacement)


For each of the experiments described below, we will recruit groups of participants (n\textgreater=10). 

## [[ARGP Experiments]]
### [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]]

### [[ARGP Experiment 2 - Add distractors]]

  - Same as above, but with distractors (landault C's)

  - Variants
    - Constant visual density - Add enough distractors to each condition so the visual density is the same as the "dense" condition
    - Constant foothold density - Keep the foothold density the same, but add variable amount of distractors per condition (good for 'perceptual crowding' research, e.g. Bex)
    - Per target - Only put distractors around a sub-set of targets, use to determine how much peeps will deviate from PGC to avoid more difficult perceptual decisions
    - Manipulate perceptual difficulty - vary perceptual difference between target and disctract (e.g. via Landault C gap shrinking, or like, a contrast distinction (empty vs non-empty bullseyes), a semantic distinction (stepping on letters, vowels targets, consonants distractors), cognitive load (stepping on letters, must spell words; stepping on numbers only step on multiples of even numbers(easy), or multiples of 3(medium), 7(hard), etc )


### Experiment 3 - Contrived paths

  - Examine gaze/foothold patterns from Aim 1 and Exp 1/2 to determine 'typical' gaze patterns/path selections
  
  - Based on that, create arrangements with "dead-zones" (e.g. large sections of terrain without footholds), with and without "funnels" (i.e. a series of *perfect* steps that lead to a dead-zone)
  
    - examine gaze/gait patterns in these conditions to see when/if subjects notice the coming dead-zone, and how they react to it (i.e. big deviations from PGC (e.g. "whoopsie")? or do they see it coming and avoid more gracefully? cite Barton Matthis Fajen)
    
    - different gaze/gait patterns that occur in different cases (i.e. last-minute replan in a "whoopsie" vs. early replan in a graceful avoidance)
  
  - ALSO/OR - big swoopy curvy paths to look at planning on straight-aheads vs curves (help with the 'planning horizon' thing, because decouples look ahead from path planning due to curvature)
  
    - decouples end-goal planning from short-term step planning
