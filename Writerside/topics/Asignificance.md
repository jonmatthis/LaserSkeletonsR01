# Significance

A.1 Human behavior in real-world environments relies on sequences of sensorimotor decisions

Visual perception and human movement (ocular motor control, reaching) are crucial to understanding real-world environments.
The ability to take action and adjust your own input influences learning.
There is a lack of datasets with stored actions to study this.
Most existing datasets aren't egocentric or do not include complete body pose information.
The interdisciplinary nature of the problem is a challenge for creating the tools.

A.2 Humans have a robust visuomotor control system that supports walking in complex environments.

The biomechanics of walking constrains visual behavior, influencing where we look.
Humans incorporate upcoming obstacles to maximize energetic efficiency.
The visual system works to provide information relevant to the goals of the perceiver, reducing uncertainty.

A.3 Visual search patterns are efficient and task-dependent

Search patterns are fixation-efficient and eye movements are made to maximize the probability of finding the target.
Visual search is highly task-dependent, efficiently serving the current task demands.
Walkers fixate where they want to step as opposed to visually salient terrain.
The proprioceptive information of biomechanics might influence visual search.

A.4 Something about energetic efficiency

Humans are good at moving and adjusting movement in a way that doesn't interfere much with being a large lumpy biped.
Humans are constantly adapting their gait to maintain energetically optimal movements.
The visual system must be seeking information which allows for energetically efficient foot placements.

A.5 Summary of significance

The proposal is significant because it is designed to specifically address how the visuo-locomotor system might be affected by aging and disease.
There is a gap in our understanding of this system, restricting our knowledge of its potential impacts.
