# Specific Aims

## Introduction

Need intergated picture to understand natural behavior

High level: 
- Vision stuff
- Body stuff
- Integrated stuff



## Aim1: Visual/Oculomotor Aspects for Foothold Finding
### Examination of eye movement sequences.
### Timing of eye movements relative to footsteps.
### Impact of divided attention and task switching.
### Information necessary for the task when no secondary task is present.
### Use of ARGP to analyze fixations on footholds versus distractors.
### Distinguishing between fixations for information gathering and those for steering/posture.

## Aim2: Motor/Biomechanical Aspects of foothold finding
### Factors determining foothold locations: reaching the destination, minimizing energy costs, avoiding unstable terrain.
### Biomechanical definitions of good footholds.
### Visual identification of good footholds by people.

## Aim3: Visuolocomotor control of locomotion 
### Measuring step efficiency and its variations.
### Replicating Kuo's obstacle adjustment experiment for lateral movements.
### Applying strategies to outdoor data to test generalizability.
