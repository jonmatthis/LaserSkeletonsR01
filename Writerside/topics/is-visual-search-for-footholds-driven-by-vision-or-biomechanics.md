# Is Visual Search for Footholds driven by Vision or Biomechanics


Hypothesis to test:

 Are fixation patterns driven by biomechanics ("I wish I could step there, so I will look there and see if there's a foothold available) or vision ("Peripheral cues suggest there's a foothold there, so let me fixate it to see if its something I want to put my foot on it")

## Both, duh. 

obviously its gonna be gonna be a combo of both, but how/when do they trade off?
