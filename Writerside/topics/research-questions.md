# Research Questions

## [[Is Visual Search for Footholds driven by Vision or Biomechanics]]


- What gaze patterns do we use during walking?
  - for foothold-finding?
  - for path-planning / steering?
  - what are the "motifs" in gaze sequences?
- Precision questions for ARGP
  - Are "foothold fixations" limited to the actual place you'll be stepping or do you "look around"
  - How does this change with density?
  - How does this change with distractors? 
- How do we fixate (or shift our gaze) during walking?
  - How long are the fixations?
  - How many per second
  - How do fixation length and fixation frequency trade off with walking speed?
- When do we fixate (or shift our gaze) during walking
  - When do the fixations occur during the gait cycle
  - When do saccades occur?
  - How does this depend on gaze elevation (proxy for task)? 
- What makes a good foothold?
  - Are footholds locations flat? yes
  - Are footholds near the location predicted by the preferred gait cycle? yes
    - When do we see deviations?  What eye movements are those deviations associated with?
  - Are footholds locations at the same height as the previous and next footholds?
  - what features in the scene are best for detecting the above ^? retinal flow? binocular depth? 
- How do eye movements work during steering?
- Steering as decision-making in walking
  - tortuousity trades off with step height
  - tortuousity trades off with ??
- Deviations from the preferred gait cycle (large = ~instability)
  - Relationship to gaze before/during/after instability?
- Individual differences:
  - in gaze sequences
  - in deviations from preferred gait cycle
