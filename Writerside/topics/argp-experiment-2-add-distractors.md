# ARGP Experiment 2 - Add distractors

#argp-schema

## Manipulation
Similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]], but now there are Distractors mixed in with the targets
- Distractors look (parameterizably) similar to Targets, but stepping on them is the same as stepping on the floor
 
## Task Constraints
Same/similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]]

## Controls for: 
Same/simlar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]] unless otherwise denoted here 

## Does not control for
- Target/distractor ratio
  
## Planned Analyses

Similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]]

- Can also look at [[Fixations on Distractors]]


OLD NOTES

  - Same as above, but with distractors (landault C's)

  - Variants
    - Constant visual density - Add enough distractors to each condition so the visual density is the same as the "dense" condition
    - Constant foothold density - Keep the foothold density the same, but add variable amount of distractors per condition (good for 'perceptual crowding' research, e.g. Bex)
    - Per target - Only put distractors around a sub-set of targets, use to determine how much peeps will deviate from PGC to avoid more difficult perceptual decisions
    - Manipulate perceptual difficulty - vary perceptual difference between target and disctract (e.g. via Landault C gap shrinking, or like, a contrast distinction (empty vs non-empty bullseyes), a semantic distinction (stepping on letters, vowels targets, consonants distractors), cognitive load (stepping on letters, must spell words; stepping on numbers only step on multiples of even numbers(easy), or multiples of 3(medium), 7(hard), etc )
