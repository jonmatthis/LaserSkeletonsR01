# Preferred Gait Cycle (PGC)

## Characterizing the preferred gait cycle
### Walking speed
- Highest level variable big dum dum variable - most directly related to the 'task' (i.e. get yr body from here to there)
### Step length
- defines basic 'compass gait' walker dynamics (e.g. Garcia et al 1995 or so? the 'simplest walking model' one), as step length is correlated with impact forces, etc
  - e.g. Kuo et al 2007, Donelan et al 2002, etc
### Step timing
- somehow spinal CPGs + 'limb resonant frequency' related (e.g. Donelan stuff, that old paper about limb resonant frequencies - neville hogan or something? Holt? )
### Step width
- less relevant to global physics/dynamics. Its more of a 'steering' thing (e.g. Bauby and Kuo 2000)
  - since the preferred path from A to B is a straight line, any M/L deviation is considered a 'cost'
  - Also, normal human step width is dang near 0 in free walking, so it will be pretty easy to measure deviations
  - also, `cross-over steps' with negative width are worth looking at!


## Planned Comparisons
- Examine how these characteristics change as participants walk through different conditions, interpretting changes from PGC as trade-offs occurring in service of some other point of value.

- Use devitions from PGC as a way to target specific sections of behavior for deeper analysis (see 'massed data' vs 'per-action data' below)

- In Lab study - we can fiddle with the knobs to figure out what the 'trade-offs' are w.r.t. gait parameters and environmental/task constraints.
    - then compare that to Outdoor data in order to characterize the 'challenge/trade-off/etc profile' of the outdoor terrain in order to figure out what makes a given terrain 'challenging' and how those challenges are adapted to at the musculoskeletal level (applications for aging - assist in characterizing multi-dimensional functional declines. i.e. perceptual vs cognitive vs motor vs musculoskeletal, etc)
