# Augmented Reality Ground Plane (ARGP)

The Augmented Reality Ground Plane (developed at Northeastern) is a projector-based, 14m-long indoor walking path. The content of the groundplane is displayed using a series of 3x ultra-short-throw projectors showing images from a Unity game engine that is streaming in realtime kinematic data via websocket. Note that the "realtime" streaming component only needs track feet, so it can be fast while we also record much higher spatial/temportal res videos for later analysis projectors and is real-time interactive, allowing for body-position-dependent updating of displayed terrain, and play real-time auditory feedback to the participant (this is essential for high accuracy footplacement)


For each of the experiments described below, we will recruit groups of participants (n\textgreater=10).
