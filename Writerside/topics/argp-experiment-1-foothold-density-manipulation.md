# ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation

#argp-schema

## Manipulation - Foothold Density
  - DENSE: 
    - many footholds
    - Presumably easist condition
  - SPARSE = few footholds, difficult)
   
## Task Constraints
- Walk from Start to End at "comfortable speed"
  - Enforcement: Time Out => Restart
- Only step on Targets
  - Enforcement: Too Many Misses => Restart


## Controls for: 
- Target size (could make them bigger to be easier)
- Target/Distractor ratio (No distractors)
- Dead ends (Randomize)
- Target Appearance

## Does not control for
- Visual density



## Planned Analyses

### Deviations from "Baseline" Performance
- Compute [[Within-subject functional, self-normalized, behavioral profiles]] for [[Free Walking]] condition plus each Task condition
- Identify when 'performance' drops off relative to:
  - [[Free Walking]] for [[Preferred Gait Cycle]]
  - Easiest condition (DENSE) for [[Vision-ish Analyses]] and [[Laser Skeleton Analyses]]
  - see: 
    - [[Matthis and Fajen 2013 (J Exp Psych: HPP)]]
    - [[Matthis and Fajen 2014 (Proceedings of the Royal Society B)]]
    - [[Matthis and Fajen 2015 (Journal of Vision)]]

### Look for correspondance between the Behavioral profiles in the different conditions and [[Aim 1 - Real-world Recordings]]
- [[Behavioral Performance Kernels across Data Time Scales]]
