# Specific Aims

[//]: # (## Aim 1 - Outdoor get a buncha real-world laser skeleton data)
[//]: # (## Aim 2 - Augmented Reality Ground Plane - lab based laser skeleton data )

## 1 - Skeleton stuff (biomechanics, motor control, etc) 
    - Strategies for foot placement and whatnot 
    - Stuff that  uses mocap data (but no eye tracking data)
        - Preffered gait cycle stuff
        - Efficient movement (Linear inverted pendulum stuff) 
        - Enegery recover ratios in different conditions

## 2 - Vision Stuff (visual search, oculomotor whosits, retinal info stuff) 
    - Strategies for lasers slinging on complex terrain
    - Stuff that uses eye tracking data + eye_center trajectory data
        - Visual search
            - i.e. Najemnik & Geisler (2005)
            - i.e. RV1 stuff
            - i.e. any Curl/Divergence stuff

## 3 - The integration (how Aim 1 and Aim 2 work together) 
    - Stuff that requires both eye tracking & mocap data
        - Gaze relative to foothod stuff
        - Any path planning stuff
        - The thing from Karl's study where you're lookin at surface normals to find viable footholds
        - The 'contrived path' stuff (and really any of the 'experimental design' manipulations in the ARGP study)
        - "Are you making saccades in service of preffered gait cycle, or likely target based on peripheral vision?" stuff


## Here are the main  research questions currently listed in Aim 1

1. How do walkers allocate gaze (spatially and temporally) during foothold finding? What is the planning horizon?

2. How is gaze allocation modulated by step-to-step gait efficiency?

3. What makes a ``good'' foothold?

5. How does divided attention impact the visuomotor control of walking?

6. Divided attention hypotheses:
    - [i. Gaze Allocation]
    - [ii. Step-to-step gait efficiency]
    - [iii Foothold properties]
    - [iv. Ground Clearance]


## Here's what botto said are the main research questions in Aim2.md
- Are fixation patterns driven by biomechanics or vision?
- How do people adapt their gaze and foothold selections in different conditions?
- What are the typical gaze patterns and path selections?
- How do people react to unexpected terrain changes, and how does this affect their gaze and gait patterns?
- How does planning change when walking on straight paths vs curved paths?
