# ARGP Experiment 2 - Add distractors

## Manipulation
Similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]], but now there are Distractors mixed in with the targets
- Distractors look (parameterizably) similar to Targets, but stepping on them is the same as stepping on the floor
 
## Task Constraints
Same/similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]]

## Controls for: 
Same/simlar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]] unless otherwise denoted here 

## Does not control for
- Target/distractor ratio
  
## Planned Analyses

Similar to [[ARGP Experiment 1 - Foothold density manipulation]]

- Can also look at [[Fixations on Distractors]]
