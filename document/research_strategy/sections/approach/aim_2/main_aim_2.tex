AUGMENTED REALITY GROUND PLANE - Laboratory-precision measurements of
visually-guided walking

\emph{Rationale:}

Why do we need Laboratory-precision measurements?

- Accuracy (can't trust kinematics of IMU systems)
- Controllable/parameterizable terrain (can make contrived terrain configurations to test specific hypotheses)
- Allows for hypothesis testing (outdoor work is 'quasi-observational; - good for *generating* hypotheses, indoor work necessary to *test* them)


\emph{General Methods:} The Augmented Reality Ground-Plane (ARGP,
developed at Northeastern) is a projector-based, 14m-long indoor walking
path. The content of the groundplane is displayed using a series of 3x ultra-short-throw projectors
projectors and is real-time interactive, allowing for body-position-dependent updating of displayed terrain, and play real-time auditory feedback to the participant (this is essential for high accuracy footplacement)

For each of the experiments described below, we will recruit groups of
participants (n\textgreater=10) from the Northeastern Community.

\subsection{Gaze/Gait relationship in terrain of various foothold density}
- Experiment (or condition?) #1 - Foothold density manipulation
  - 5 levels of foothold density (dense = many footholds, easy; sparse = few footholds, difficult)
- Experiment (or condition) #2 - Add distractors
  - Same as above, but with distractors (landault C's)
  - Add enough distractors to each condition so they visual density is the same as the "dense" condition
- Experiment #3 - Contrived paths
  - Examine gaze/foothold patterns from Aim 1 and Exp 1/2 to determine 'typical' gaze patterns/path selections
  - Based on that, create arrangements with "dead-zones" (e.g. large sections of terrain without footholds), with and without "funnels" (i.e. a series of *perfect* steps that lead to a dead-zone)
    - examine gaze/gait patterns in these conditions to see when/if subjects notice the coming dead-zone, and how they react to it (i.e. big deviations from PGC (e.g. "whoopsie")? or do they see it coming and avoid more gracefully? cite Barton Matthis Fajen)
    - different gaze/gait patterns that occur in different cases (i.e. last-minute replan in a "whoopsie" vs. early replan in a graceful avoidance)
  - ALSO/OR - big swoopy curvy paths to look at planning on straight-aheads vs curves (help with the 'planning horizon' thing, because decouples look ahead from path planning due to curvature)


# Analyses

- Hypothesis to test: Are fixation patterns driven by biomechanics ("I wish I could step there, so I will look there and see if there's a foothold available) or vision ("Peripheral cues suggest there's a foothold there, so let me fixate it to see if its something I want to put my foot on it")
  - e.g. Fig 2 of Trent's f32
- Baseline modelling
  - Gaze/gait integration:
    - how hard are peeps fixating footholds in the different conditions?
        - e.g. figs 3, 4,5, in Matthis Current Bio
  - Basic stats:
    - look ahead distance vs timing (prediction - timing is constant-ish in 1.5-2sec range, look ahead distance varies with terrain/walking speed)
    - deviations from PGC (prediction - deviations are larger in sparse terrain, and in distractor conditions, e.g. Fig 2 Matthis Current Bio)
    - speed fluctuations (prediction - speed fluctuations are larger in sparse terrain, and in distractor conditions, e.g. 'energy recovery' in matthis 2013 (proc roy soc B), figs 4, 5)
    - fixation duration (no real predictions, but a stat to compare/diffrentiate between conditions)
  - Body-centered:
      - LIP model (COM trajectory relative to planted foot, e.g. Koolen/Rebula/Pratt paper, Matthis Fajen 2013,14, etc)
      - Prefered gait cycle (literally just step length, width, timing, e.g. Donelan stuff, e.g. Fig 2 Matthis current bio)
  - Retinal-centered:
      - Retinal optic flow div/curl relative to eyeball trajecotories (e.g. Matthis et al 2023)
        - look for increased stabilization in distractor vs no-distractor conditions (e.g. exp 1/2), e.g. 'do subs fixate harder so I can tell if its a distractor or not'
        - Retinal optic flow div/curl relative to COM trajectory (e.g. Matthis et al 2023), e.g. looking for retinal correlats of full-body steering
      - Visual Search - e.g. Najemnik/Geisler visual search stuff, e.g. likelihood of finding a target in a given area of the visual field (using RV1 model)

%\item
%  What is the planning horizon? Measured as in Darici \& Kuo 2023.
%  Measured by gaze paths as well, keeping in mind that we might use

%  Do people exhibit optimal control when we take into account the
%  changes to the path characteristics (path shape and foothold density)?
%  {[}Is there previous work to suggest that lateral deviations in path
%  should cause the kinds of changes that the vertical blocks cause in

%  yes\ldots{} if you have to take a shorter step or move more laterally
