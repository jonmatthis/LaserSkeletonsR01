# Data Time Scales

Data happens at different time scales, from BIG massed data (i.e. what a the general stats of behavior in the entire condition?)

To smaller scaled "Per Action" data (e.g. per step, per fixation, etc)

i.e. what was going on when the subject did that specific thing? (e.g. what was the fixation duration when the subject took that step?)
