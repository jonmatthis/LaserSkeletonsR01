# Real-world vs Lab-based Virtuous Research Cycle

## Rationale:
Outdoor work is 'quasi-observational' - good for *generating* hypotheses, but indoor work necessary to *test* them 

### Real world is good for: 
- Ecologically Valid behavior
- Huge Gobs of [[Massed Data]]
  - Much longer [[Per Walk]] data means more opportunity for studying [[Per Step Planning Window]] data
- Complex environments with actual geometry [[Photgrammetry Meshes]]


### Lab-based is good for

  - Accuracy (can't trust kinematics of IMU systems)
      - [[Photgrammetry Meshes]] are nice, but still not going to be as good

  - Controllable/parameterizable terrain (can make contrived terrain configurations to test specific hypotheses)
  - Allows for hypothesis testing
