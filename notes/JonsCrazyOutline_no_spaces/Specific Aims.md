# Specific Aims

## Aim1: Gaze Strategies for Foothold Finding
### Examination of eye movement sequences.
### Timing of eye movements relative to footsteps.
### Impact of divided attention and task switching.
### Information necessary for the task when no secondary task is present.
### Use of ARGP to analyze fixations on footholds versus distractors.
### Distinguishing between fixations for information gathering and those for steering/posture.

## Aim2: Characteristics of a Good Foothold
### Factors determining foothold locations: reaching the destination, minimizing energy costs, avoiding unstable terrain.
### Biomechanical definitions of good footholds.
### Visual identification of good footholds by people.

## Aim3: Adjusting Gait for Obstacles and Direction Changes
### Measuring step efficiency and its variations.
### Replicating Kuo's obstacle adjustment experiment for lateral movements.
### Applying strategies to outdoor data to test generalizability.
