# Within-subject functional, self-normalized, behavioral profiles

- All studies will be within-subjects designs, with each participant completing all conditions.    
    - We don't need to worry about inter-subject variability (which would be quite high b/c people are complicated) - its like 'auto-normalization' or ' functional self-normalization' or something
        - We should cite some "individual differences" papers here, e.g. maybe some Monica Daley stuff?
- Participants will complete "free walking" trials wherein they'll walk from Start to End a `number_of_trials_per_condition` time at a 'comfortable walking pace'
    - We will then use data from these conditions as a 'baseline' measurement of 'preferred gait cycle' (PGC) for each participant, which is presumed to be the 'optimal' configuration on whatever internal value system folks use (Donelan/Selinger 2006ish)
