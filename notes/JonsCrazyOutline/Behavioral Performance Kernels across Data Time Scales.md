# Comparison of Behavioral Performance Kernels across Data Time Scales between Real-world and Lab-based conditions

- Compute [[Within-subject functional, self-normalized, behavioral profiles]] for subjects in different [[Aim 2 - Lab-based Experiments]] condtions
  - Convolve with data from [[Aim 1 - Real-world Recordings]]
    - A profile at a given [[Data Time Scales]] can be convolved at greater timescales
      - i.e. a given pattern in the [[Per Stride]] can be convolved across:
        - [[Per Step Planning Window]]
        - [[Per Walk]]
        - [[Per Partipcant]]
        - etc
