**RESPECTIVE CONTRIBUTIONS**

I have designed the proposed series of experiments with the help of my
sponsor, Dr. Jonathan Matthis, and my co-sponsors, Drs. Peter Bex and
Dagmar Sternad. Dr. Matthis and I wrote the original research proposal
together before sending it to my co-sponsors, and once we received their
feedback, we incorporated their suggestions and insight. I will be
responsible for executing all components of the proposed research. As I
start each experiment, Dr. Matthis will provide the direct guidance and
training on eye tracking and motion capture technologies used to measure
visuo-locomotor behavior. As relevant, Dr. Peter Bex and Dr. Dagmar
Sternad will provide insight into analysis of eye movement and motor
neuroscience, respectively.
