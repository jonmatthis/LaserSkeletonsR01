**Inclusion of Individuals Across Lifespan**

Children (individuals under the age of 18) will be excluded from this
study. This study focuses on the adult visuo-locomotor system because of
empirical and scientific complexities that would arise from studying an
undeveloped adolescent or younger visuo-locomotor system. The
development of visuo-locomotor behavior in children is a worthy topic of
research, but goes outside of the scope of the proposed studies. The
researchers in the Matthis Lab and at Northeastern have extensive
experience conducting research with humans of all ages.
