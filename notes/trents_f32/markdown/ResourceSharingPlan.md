***RESOURCE SHARING PLAN***

We intend to make as much as possible of the data collected in these
research activities available to the larger scientific community, in
order to increase the impact of these endeavors.

***General plan and management for resource sharing***

During the execution of research activities, data will be shared by way
of secured external hard drives and secure online data storage systems
(such as Google Drive and Box, maintained by the Northeastern IT
services department). As part of publication of a particular part of
this research proposal, we will also make available the data and
selected analysis code using reputable online services that provide DOIs
for their hosted content.

***Description of the specific resources to be shared***

*a) Full body motion capture data.* This data will derive from the
Qualisys motion capture system and the AMTI force plate system. The data
will be converted into a non-proprietary data format prior to sharing.

*b) Analysis code.* Analysis and modeling code will be posted on GitHub.
The code will be written in Matlab, Python, and R.

e*) Eye-tracking data.* We expect that the use of head-mounted gaze and
scene cameras for freely-moving human experiments will be of broad
interest. We will distribute this data using reputable online
repositories. The videos will not contain the faces of any person not
involved in these experiments
