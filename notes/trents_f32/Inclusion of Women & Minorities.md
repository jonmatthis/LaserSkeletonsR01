**Inclusion of Women and Minorities**

Each experiment will involve approximately 6 adult subjects, recruited
from the university community. Since the experiments involve normal
walking in outdoor environments we do not expect any differences the
depend on sex or minority status. However, we will try to balance the
number of males and females and can examine the data for possible
differences. Otherwise the subjects should reflect the ethnic
composition of the University community. We will recruit only subjects
over 18 so the experiments will not involve children.
