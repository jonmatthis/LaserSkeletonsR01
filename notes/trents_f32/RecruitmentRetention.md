**Recruitment and Retention**

Subjects are typically recruited from flyers across campus or from the
Psychology Department subject recruitment website. Subjects are
typically undergraduates, either paid or participating as part of the
Departmental requirements. Since the study involves normal walking we
also use volunteer graduate students who are interested in the project.

Because data collection requires no more than one session, and the
number of subjects is typically small, retention is not usually a
problem. If a subject drops out we simply continue recruiting.
