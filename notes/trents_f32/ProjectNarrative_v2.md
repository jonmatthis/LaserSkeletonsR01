**Project Narrative**

An outstanding complexity of the visuo-locomotor system is understanding
how upcoming footholds are found during visual search. Independently,
the study of visual search and the biomechanics of locomotion have both
received a great deal of attention, but there is little research
addressing their critical overlap. By building our basic science
understanding of how visual search adapts to the unique context of
locomotion, we will be better equipped to understand how the
visuo-locomotor system might be affected by retinal and motor diseases.
